## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

Although my code is messy as hell, this project was helpful for getting me back into writing CSS. It also helped teach me about flex, displaying things on the center of the page, and using keyframes for animation. 

I'd like to keep moving forward and use Frontend Mentor's projects to help build my skills with CSS & Javascript in particular. This is hopefully just the first step in that journey.
